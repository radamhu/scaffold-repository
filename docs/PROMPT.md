Prompt for reference: Create a responsive image gallery that dynamically loads images from a set of URLs and displays them in a grid layout. Implement infinite scroll so new images load seamlessly as the user scrolls down. Add dynamic filtering to allow users to filter images by categories like landscape or portrait, with an instant update to the displayed gallery. The gallery must be fully responsive, adjusting the number of columns based on screen size using CSS Grid or Flexbox. Include lazy loading for images and smooth hover effects, such as zoom-in or shadow on hover. Simulate image loading with mock API calls and ensure smooth transitions when images are loaded or filtered. The solution should be built with HTML, CSS (with Flexbox/Grid), and JavaScript, and should be clean, modular, and performant.
